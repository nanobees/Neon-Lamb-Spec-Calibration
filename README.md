# Neon-Lamb-Spec-Calibration
A Neon Lamb Circuit for Calibrating the Optical Spectroscopy System of Our Lab

This easy circuit is designed for calibrating the optical spectroscopy system of our lab. The spectroscopy system is built
with a Newport Monochromator, an f/# matcher and a photodetector with a DAQ card for data acquisiton. In order to ensure 
that we take scientifically accurate data, we use neon lamb which has a well defined spectrum.
